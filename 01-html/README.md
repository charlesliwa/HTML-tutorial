### STEP 3: Project Folder Setup

Create a new folder on your computer to store your project files. This helps keep your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files organized in one place.

### STEP 4: index.html

Inside your project folder, create a new file named index.html. This will be the main page of your website — most browsers automatically load index.html first.

### STEP 5: Live Server Extension

Install the Live Server extension in VS Code. It allows you to preview your webpage in a browser and automatically refreshes it whenever you save your changes.

### STEP 6: !DOCTYPE html

This declaration tells the browser that the document is written in HTML5. It ensures your webpage is displayed correctly.

```<!DOCTYPE html> ```


### STEP 7: html

The <html> element wraps all the content of your page. It tells the browser that everything inside is part of an HTML document.


```<html></html> ```

### STEP 8: head

The <head> section contains meta information about your webpage, such as the title, character encoding, and links to stylesheets or scripts. This section’s content does not appear on the webpage itself.

```<head></head>```


### STEP 9: title

The <title> tag defines the title of the webpage, which appears on the browser tab.

```<title>My First Website</title>```

### STEP 10: body

The <body> tag contains everything visible on your webpage text, images, links, and more.

```<body></body>```

### STEP 11: headings

Headings are used to organize and structure content. They range from <h1> (most important) to <h6> (least important).

```<h1>Main Heading</h1><h2>Subheading</h2>```

### STEP 12: p

The <p> tag defines a paragraph of text.

```html <p>This is a paragraph.</p>```

### STEP 13: br

The <br> tag inserts a single line break it’s useful for spacing text without starting a new paragraph.

```Line one.<br>Line two.```

### STEP 14: hr

The <hr> tag adds a horizontal line, often used to separate content sections.

``` <hr>```

### STEP 15: pre

The <pre> tag displays text exactly as it’s written in the code including spaces and line breaks. It’s useful for code samples or formatted text.

``` <pre>
This text
    keeps its spacing.
</pre>```
